</article>

<div><b>Abstract:</b> Existing emotional speech corpora are often either highly curated to induce certain emotions from
    predefined categories, or it is difficult to dissect whether the judgment made by the annotators arise from semantic
    or prosodic cues. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new approach called `Genetic Algorithm with Peopleâ€™
    (GAP), which integrates human decision and production into a genetic algorithm. In our design, we allow human
    creators and raters to synchronously optimize the emotional prosody over each generation by introducing evolutionary
    pressure. We then compare GAP with state-of-the-art emotional speech corpora to examine its robustness. We
    demonstrate that GAP is able to efficiently sample from the high dimensional emotion speech space and capture wide
    variety of emotions, with no presumptions about the dimensionality of the space. Our approach has great potential to
    scale and extend to other languages, which will allow for creating multilingual corpora to make cross-cultural
    comparisons.
